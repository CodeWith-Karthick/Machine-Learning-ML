## 🧠 Projects Included

### 1. 📉 Customer Churn Prediction
- **File**: `Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`
- **Overview**: Predicts whether a customer will leave a telecom company using classification algorithms.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
  - Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall

### 2. 📩 SMS Spam Detection
- **File**: `SMS_spam_detection_.ipynb`
- **Overview**: Classifies SMS messages as spam or ham using Natural Language Processing.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF)
  - Naive Bayes Classifier
  - Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report

### 3. 🎬 Movie Genre Classification
- **File**: `movie-genre-classification.ipynb`
- **Overview**: Predicts the genre of a movie based on plot summary or metadata.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - NLP vectorization (Bag-of-Words / TF-IDF)
  - Multi-class classification using ML models
  - Performance evaluation using accuracy and F1 score
