CodeWith-Karthick 🚀
A collection of applied machine learning projects focused on real-world problems like customer churn prediction, SMS spam detection, and movie genre classification. This repository showcases practical implementations using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and widely-used ML libraries.

🧠 Projects Included
1. 📉 Customer Churn Prediction
File: Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb

Overview: Predicts whether a customer will leave a telecom company using classification algorithms.

Key Techniques:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall

2. 📩 SMS Spam Detection
File: SMS_spam_detection_.ipynb

Overview: Classifies SMS messages as spam or ham using Natural Language Processing.

Key Techniques:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, TF-IDF)

Naive Bayes Classifier

Evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report

3. 🎬 Movie Genre Classification
File: movie-genre-classification.ipynb

Overview: Predicts the genre of a movie based on plot summary or metadata.

Key Techniques:

NLP vectorization (Bag-of-Words / TF-IDF)

Multi-class classification using various ML models

Performance evaluation using accuracy and F1 score
